# Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, offers a rich playground for exploring fundamental principles of physics. This problem focuses on analyzing how the **range** of a projectile depends on its **angle of projection**. Beneath the surface lies a versatile framework involving linear and quadratic relationships that form the foundation of classical mechanics.

### Parameters:
- Initial velocity (vâ‚€)
- Gravitational acceleration (g)
- Launch angle (Î¸)
- Launch height (h, optional)

## ðŸ“˜ 1. Theoretical Foundation

Using kinematic equations, the position of a projectile at time `t` is:

- Horizontal:  
  $$ x(t) = v_0 \cdot \cos(\\theta) \cdot t $$

- Vertical:  
  $$ y(t) = v_0 \cdot \sin(\\theta) \cdot t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$

Assuming the projectile lands at the same height it was launched:

### Time of flight:
$$ t = \\frac{2v_0 \sin(\\theta)}{g} $$

### Horizontal range:
$$ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\cdot \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$

This shows the range depends on **sin(2Î¸)**, which peaks at 45Â° for maximum distance.

## ðŸ“Š 2. Analysis of the Range

- As Î¸ varies from 0Â° to 90Â°, the range follows a **sine curve**.
- For fixed `vâ‚€`, the range is maximum when Î¸ = 45Â°.
- Different `vâ‚€` values vertically scale the curve.
- If launch height â‰  0, range increases asymmetrically.
