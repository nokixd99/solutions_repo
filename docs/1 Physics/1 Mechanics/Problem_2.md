# Problem 2: Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum

---

## 🎯 Motivation

The forced damped pendulum is a fascinating example of nonlinear dynamics where damping, restoring force, and external driving force interact to produce a rich variety of behaviors — from regular oscillations to chaos. This system models many real-world phenomena, such as driven oscillators in electronics, energy harvesting devices, or even weather systems.

## 🧠 1. Theoretical Foundation

The general equation of motion for a forced damped pendulum is:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \sin(\theta) = A \cos(\omega t)
$$

Where:

- \( \theta(t) \): angular displacement
- \( \beta \): damping coefficient
- \( \omega_0 \): natural frequency \( \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}} \)
- \( A \): amplitude of the driving force
- \( \omega \): driving frequency

### 🔹 Small Angle Approximation:

For small angles \( \theta \ll 1 \), we can linearize the equation:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = A \cos(\omega t)
$$

This has an analytical solution involving resonance. But for larger angles or general behavior, **numerical simulation** is necessary.

## 📊 2. Analysis of Dynamics

We will analyze how the system's behavior changes as we vary:

- Damping coefficient \( \beta \)
- Driving amplitude \( A \)
- Driving frequency \( \omega \)

The system transitions between:

- **Periodic motion**
- **Quasiperiodic motion**
- **Chaotic motion**

We'll illustrate this using phase portraits, time series, and Poincaré sections.
The behavior of the forced damped pendulum is highly sensitive to its physical parameters. The main parameters to consider are:

- **Damping coefficient (β):** Represents friction or resistance. Higher damping slows the system and suppresses oscillations.
- **Driving amplitude (A):** The strength of the external force. A larger A can push the system into chaotic behavior.
- **Driving frequency (ω):** Determines how the external force interacts with the natural frequency of the system.

### 📈 Behavioral Regimes:

Depending on these parameters, the pendulum can exhibit:

- **Underdamped Oscillations:** Smooth, sinusoidal motion when damping is low.
- **Critical Damping:** The threshold at which the system returns to equilibrium fastest without oscillating.
- **Overdamped Motion:** Very slow return to equilibrium.
- **Resonance:** Occurs when the driving frequency \( \omega \) ≈ natural frequency \( \omega_0 \), leading to maximum amplitude.
- **Chaotic Motion:** When A and β are within specific ranges, the system becomes highly sensitive to initial conditions, displaying non-periodic, unpredictable motion.

---

### 🔄 Transition to Chaos:

As we increase the driving amplitude and slightly vary the frequency, the motion transitions from periodic to quasi-periodic, and eventually to chaotic. This can be visualized through:

- **Phase Portraits:** Plots of angular velocity versus angular displacement (\( \dot{\theta} \) vs \( \theta \)).
- **Poincaré Sections:** Sampling the system state at regular intervals to reveal hidden structures.
- **Bifurcation Diagrams:** Showing how steady states evolve with changing parameters.

These tools help in identifying and visualizing complex dynamics in nonlinear systems.

## 🛠️ 3. Python Simulation

We will use `scipy` to solve the nonlinear differential equation numerically using Runge-Kutta methods.

### Example features:

- θ(t) vs t (angle over time)
- Phase portrait: \( \theta \) vs \( \dot{\theta} \)
- Poincaré sections
- (Optional) Bifurcation diagrams
