This problem focuses on analyzing how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection . Beneath the surface lies a versatile framework involving linear and quadratic relationships that form the foundation of classical mechanics. Parameters: Initial velocity (v\u2080) Gravitational acceleration (g) Launch angle (\u03b8) Launch height (h, optional) \ud83d\udcd8 1. Theoretical Foundation Using kinematic equations, the position of a projectile at time t is: Horizontal: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t $$ Vertical: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$ Assuming the projectile lands at the same height it was launched: Time of flight: \\[ t = \\\\frac{2v_0 \\sin(\\\\theta)}{g} \\] Horizontal range: \\[ R(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{v_0^2 \\\\cdot \\\\sin(2\\\\theta)}{g} \\] This shows the range depends on sin(2\u03b8) , which peaks at 45\u00b0 for maximum distance. \ud83d\udcca 2. Analysis of the Range As \u03b8 varies from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, the range follows a sine curve . For fixed v\u2080 , the range is maximum when \u03b8 = 45\u00b0. Different v\u2080 values vertically scale the curve. If launch height \u2260 0, range increases asymmetrically.
